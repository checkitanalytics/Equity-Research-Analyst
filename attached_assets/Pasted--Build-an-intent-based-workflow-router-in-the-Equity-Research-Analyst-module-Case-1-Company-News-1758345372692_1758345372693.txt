“Build an intent-based workflow router in the Equity Research Analyst module:

Case 1 – Company News / Rumors / Product or Drug Launch
If the user asks about company news, rumor verification, new product launches, or new drug releases → go into Intelligent Stock News Analyst.

Case 2 – Earnings / Financial Analysis
If the user asks about company earnings (financial statement analysis, earnings date, earnings preview, guidance, revenue, EPS, margins, etc.) → go into Earning Call Specialist.

Case 3 – Valuation
If the user asks about valuation (short-term or long-term valuation, price targets, DCF, multiples, intrinsic value, etc.) → go into Valuation Expert.

The system should automatically detect the intent based on user input and route them to the correct module.”
